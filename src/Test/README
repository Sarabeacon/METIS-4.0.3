This directory contains three test programs.

ndcompare <GraphFile>
  This programs reads in a graph and performs four orderings.
  The first three of them are using onmetis but with the three
  different matching schemes. The fourth ordering uses oemetis.
  It reports the number of non-zeros for all four of them.
  It is a good program to test the various matching schemes.

pwtest <GraphFile> <Nparts>
  This program can be used to test the METIS_WPartGraphRecursive routine

kwtest <GraphFile> <Nparts>
  This program can be used to test the METIS_WPartGraphKway routine
