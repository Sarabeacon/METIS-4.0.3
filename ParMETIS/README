This is ParMetis version 1.0. You can find the manual describing the
various routines in the directory DOC. Also, the file called INSTALL
contains instructions on how to build and test ParMetis.

Also, those how had access to the alpha versions of the code should
carefully read the CHANGES files as well as the manual, since there
have been a number of changes.


Please let me know of any problems that you have found with it.
